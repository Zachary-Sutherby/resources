  <br></br>
  <p>Description: <br>This GeoNet article descripts the workflow to use a Python script and windows task scheduler to connect to ArcGIS Online or Portal, download the survey Form item, extract the zip file to a folder. It then copies the updated media folder files from a known location into the extracted folders, zip the form item back up again and upload it to ArcGIS Online or Portal. <br></br>The field workers will need to delete the survey from their gallery in the field app on the device, re-download the survey from the Download Surveys menu, open the survey and they will have access to the updated survey and associated media files.

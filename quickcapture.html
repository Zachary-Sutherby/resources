  <p>Description: <br>This link discusses how ArcGIS QuickCapture and ArcGIS Enterprise work together. Specifically, it goes through what versions of Portal are supported, connecting QuickCapture designer to your Portal, and feature services. <br></br>If you want to work with 10.6 and 10.7 portals you need to perform manual registration of QuickCapture in your portal. This is a manual and error-prone process and it needs manually be undone if you ever upgrade your portal to a newer version. You can follow these instructions at your own risk. It is strongly recommended that you avoid working with versions of portal older than 10.7.1.  If you really have to do it and run into a problem, all you have for help is that from your QuickCapture colleagues in GeoNet. Do no attempt to follow manual registration instructions with versions older than 10.6 it will not work. <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=77ee9e40b90149c6b804a934d7ddb751#overview" target="_blank">Link for the workflow</a></br></p>
